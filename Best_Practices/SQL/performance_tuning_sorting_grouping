## Best practices for sorting and grouping ##

1. Bring order with a sort
2. Reduce similar values into a group
3. Limit data before it’s grouped
4. Return all groups
5. Limit data after it’s grouped
6. WHERE comes before GROUP BY; SQL evaluates the WHERE clause before
it groups records.
HAVING comes after GROUP BY; SQL evaluates HAVING after
it groups records.
7. Limit data after it’s grouped
8. Summarize the aggregate - WITH ROLLUP
9. Summarize each column - With cube
10. GROUPING FUNCTION WITH CUBE
