## SQL performance tuning - Best practices ##

Index:

Donâ€™t index every column

Index columns that you filter on

Only index data that you need to look up

Consider other index types 

Use indexes to pre-sort data

Use multi-column indexes, but sparingly

Look after your indexes


## Thumb Rule ##

Index ALL primary keys (I think most RDBMS do this when the table is created).
Index ALL foreign key columns.
Create more indexes ONLY if:
Queries are slow.
You know the data volume is going to increase significantly.
Run statistics when populating a lot of data in tables.
If a query is slow, look at the execution plan and:

If the query for a table only uses a few columns, put all those columns into an index, then you can help the RDBMS to only use the index.
Don't waste resources indexing tiny tables (hundreds of records).
Index multiple columns in order from high cardinality to less. This means: first index the columns with more distinct values, followed by columns with fewer distinct values.
If a query needs to access more than 10% of the data, a full scan is normally better than an index.
