Bulk data loading from external cloud storage:

1. create s3 bucket
2. create iam role and give permission
3. In snowflake create integration with role arn and storage bucket name
4. setup trust between aws and snowflake (user_arn and external id)
5. create file format
6. put the files in s3
7. load data using copy into snowflake
8. query the table

Continuous data loading:

1. Store json format data using VARIANT for creating table
2. Create s3 bucket, provide role and policy 
3. In snowflake create integration with role arn and storage bucket name
4. setup trust between aws and snowflake (user_arn and external id)
5. create file format to copy command for snowpipe with auto ingest as true
6. Provide sqs arn in s3 policy to ensure real time load
7. Whenever there is new file in s3, the event notification will go to sqs, from sqs it will trigger snow pipe
8. query the records.
